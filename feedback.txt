Feedback
--------

Design

Your revised design looks great---you have a very clear document and
are making very solid design decisions, which seem to be reflected in
your code. Your original design is lacking a little bit; in
particular, framing the parser idea around the "modify()" method is
not great because it makes it difficult to reason about correctness. A
state machine that processes chunks of music at a time is much cleaner.

Implementation

Your code looks absolutely great. Very readable, consistent, and
well-organized. The one issue is that your tuples need to be able to
process chords.


Testing

Good job on full end-to-end tests (rather than just listening ones)!
